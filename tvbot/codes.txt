662	RPL_MODECHANGEWARN	KineIRCd	['+' | '-']<mode_char> :<warning>	Plain text warning to the user about turning on or off a user mode. If no '+' or '-' prefix is used for the mode char, '+' is presumed.

671	RPL_WHOISSECURE	KineIRCd	<nick> <type> [:<info>]	Reply to WHOIS command - Returned if the target is connected securely, eg. type may be TLSv1, or SSLv2 etc. If the type is unknown, a '*' may be used.

The timezone is hours and minutes each of Greenwich ('[+/-]HHMM'). Since all timestamps sent from the server are in a similar format, this numeric is designed to give clients the ability to provide accurate timestamps to their users.

718	RPL_UMODEGMSG	RatBox	<nick> <user>@<host> :<info>	Sent to a user who is +g to inform them that someone has attempted to talk to them (via PRIVMSG/NOTICE), and that they will need to be accepted (via the ACCEPT command) before being able to talk to them

774	RPL_XINFOEND	Ithildin		Termination of an RPL_XINFO list
972	ERR_CANNOTDOCOMMAND	Unreal		Works similarly to all of KineIRCd's CANNOT* numerics. This one indicates that a command could not be performed for an arbitrary reason. For example, a halfop trying to kick an op.
973	ERR_CANNOTCHANGEUMODE	KineIRCd	<mode_char> :<reason>	Reply to MODE when a user cannot change a user mode

976	ERR_CANNOTSENDTONICK	KineIRCd	<nick> :<reason>	Returned from NOTICE, PRIVMSG or other commands to notify the user that they cannot send a message to a particular client. Similar to ERR_CANNOTSENDTOCHAN. KineIRCd uses this in conjunction with user-mode +R to allow users to block people who are not identified to services (spam avoidance)
977	ERR_UNKNOWNSERVERMODE	KineIRCd	<modechar> :<info>	Returned by MODE to inform the client they used an unknown server mode character.
979	ERR_SERVERMODELOCK	KineIRCd	<target> :<info>	Returned by MODE to inform the client the server has been set mode +L by an administrator to stop server modes being changed
980	ERR_BADCHARENCODING	KineIRCd	<command> <charset> :<info>	Returned by any command which may have had the given data modified because one or more glyphs were incorrectly encoded in the current charset (given).

For safety reasons, the invalid character is not returned to the client.
981	ERR_TOOMANYLANGUAGES	KineIRCd	<max_langs> :<info>	Returned by the LANGUAGE command to tell the client they cannot set as many languages as they have requested. To assist the client, the maximum languages which can be set at one time is given, and the language settings are not changed.

983	ERR_TEXTTOOSHORT	KineIRCd	<command> :<info>	Returned by any command requiring text (such as a message or a reason), which was not long enough to be considered valid. This was created initially to combat '/wallops foo' abuse, but is also used by DIE and RESTART commands to attempt to encourage meaningful reasons.
999	ERR_NUMERIC_ERR	Bahamut		Also known as ERR_NUMERICERR (Unreal)
